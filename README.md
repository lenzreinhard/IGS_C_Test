# IGS_C_Test

This is the IGS C Test.

To run it just uncomment each question from time to time to see the results on the console.

It is necessary to have C compiler installed.

I recommend codeblocks-20.03mingw-setup.exe (found at http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries/#imagesoswindows48pnglogo-microsoft-windows) 
program to run because that was the app used in development.
